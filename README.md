# TSN-Tensorflow-unofficial
This proeject is a reimplementation of the Temporal Segment Networks based on the original paper and the official code released (which is written in caffe and Pytorch).  
[[paper]](http://wanglimin.github.io/papers/WangXWQLTV_ECCV16.pdf)
[[code]](https://github.com/yjxiong/temporal-segment-networks)  

Also, the CNN architecture is used Tensorflow's official implementation on slim.
