# TSN-Tensorflow-unofficial
This proeject is a re-implementation of the Temporal Segment Networks based on the original paper and the official code released (which is written in caffe and Pytorch).  
[[Paper]](http://wanglimin.github.io/papers/WangXWQLTV_ECCV16.pdf)
[[Code]](https://github.com/yjxiong/temporal-segment-networks)  

Also, the Tensorflow's official implementation of the CNN architecture (with a lightweight library, TF-Slim) is used.
